# Mario-
This is a mario game created in python with processing application.
I started this project because of its complexity and the challenges it presents.
From the surface it looked pretty much simple to do but a few codes into the game presented its own challenges.
Interestingly, coding this game has got more to do with mathematics than just simple coding.
There are times that I don't even understand my own code but you know as the rule is "if it works, don't touch it".
This is how far I have come with this game and I intend to add more features to it and make it more fun.
For now I will leave it here for anyone who is interested to look into it and also play around with it. 
Who knows what it could turn out to be.
